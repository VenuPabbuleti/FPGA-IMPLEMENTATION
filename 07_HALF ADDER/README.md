# HALF ADDER
A combinational logic circuit which is designed to add two binary digits is called as a half adder.

It has two inputs and two outputs(Carry and Sum)

Carry is 1 when both the inputs are 1 else it is 0, sum is 1 when if either of inputs is 1.

  ## In FPGA Board
  
    If Switch is highe then input is 1,else input is zero

    If LED glows then output is 1 else ouput is zero
    
    ==> Switch 14 -->(SW[13])  -- input 2
    ==> Switch 13 -->(SW[12])  -- input 1
    ==> LED 14    -->(LED[13]) -- output -- Carry
    ==> LED 13    -->(LED[12]) -- output -- Sum
