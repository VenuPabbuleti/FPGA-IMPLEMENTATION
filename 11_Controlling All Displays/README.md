# CONTROLLING ALL SEVEN SEGMENT DISPLAYS

=> Here,Implementation of Binary to hexa conversion

=> 8 Seven Segment displays are controlled by 8 switches

=> Binary input is taking from 4 Switches

=> Outputs are shown on display

=> Same output is displayed , if they are ON.

Based on inputs i.e switch positons a number is displays on seven segment display

Based on Switch positions Particular seven segment display is ON or OFF.

## In FPGA Board

   ### Inputs

     -->Inputs to Display to operate Display
     SW[15] => Display 8  
     SW[14] => Display 7
     SW[13] => Display 6
     SW[12] => Display 5
     SW[11] => Display 4
     SW[10] => Display 3
     SW[9]  => Display 2
     SW[8]  => Display 1

    -->Inputs to operate Binary inputs
     SW[2]  => B[0]  --LSB
     SW[3]  => B[1]
     SW[4]  => B[2]
     SW[5]  => B[3]   --MSB


  ### Output
      Displays operates according to the switches and displayed a number provided by switches
